# Flexcel Cloud
Flexcel is a debate strategizing software for competitive high school debaters at state and national level tournaments. It has acquired over 8000 downloads and 30,000+ hours of usage. Premier Debate recognizes Flexcel as an extremely efficient tool for debaters. 

Flexcel Cloud is the next stage in the development of Flexcel. The overarching objective 
is to host Flexcel on the cloud, which will allow for anywhere access, more scalability,
access to cloud computing resources, etc.

## Vision
Flexcel Cloud is aiming to be a central access to debate resources. It is going to be more than just a flowing software. The Dashboard will consist of each debater's upcoming tournaments, debate logs, progress metrics, etc. The Flow will have a smoother workflow and more advanced features. 
## Tech Stack 
Flexcel is a web-app built with JavaScript, jQuery and packaged into a desktop environment
with Electron. Flexcel Cloud will be built using - 
1. React 
2. Backend - TBD
### Libraries
1. [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
2. [Handsontable React](https://handsontable.com/docs/8.4.0/frameworks-wrapper-for-react-installation.html) 

The fundamental shift from Flexcel to Flexcel Cloud is in the tech stack. For the frontend, it is rewriting jQuery code to React. For the backend, it is hosting the app on the cloud, instead of the  Microsoft and Apple Store.
